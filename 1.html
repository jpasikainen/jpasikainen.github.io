# Creating usable web-facing documents with minimal overhead
The web becomes more unusable as the time passes if we don't hit the breaks and turn around. Websites[0], take ages to load, are choppy to scroll, and eat still very precious and limited bandwidth. To me, text-heavy (and mission critical!) websites should provide the data in a manner that is easily digestable no matter what web compatible interface you might be on. I want to present you my views on the matter and how I tackled the issues in practice with minimal sacrifices. This post is inspired by the design of <a href="https://t0.vc/">t0.vc</a>, thanks!

## Building blocks
To me, GUI of the web is built on HTML, CSS and JS. This chapter discusses these technologies and how they can be utilized with minimal effort.

While structural components HTML and CSS are well adobted by modern browsers, they still fall short on many fronts:
- Complex
- Poorly understood
- Multiple standards and cross-incompatibility
Complexity leads to poor understanding because there are no dire consequences for misusage and there are other more interesting things to spend your time on. Oh, how painful it is to make the prettiest website out there only to realize it only works on your prefered browser. Not to mention how difficult it is to design something coherent while supporting multiple screen sizes.

So, how do you use these blocks? Throwing away the unnecessary bloat we are left with something useful: meta, style and a. That's really all you need. With meta, various hints can be given to the rendering engine of the document. For example the following one-liner (wrap in <>) makes text readable on mobile devices by not letting it overflow horizontally. It's good to keep in mind that these are just nice-to-have and can be thrown away whenever!

  meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no"

Styling with style is really something that's there just mostly to improve readibility. I personally like to have content 80 characters wide and centered. It's also nice to have some extra space between lines. However, it has some functional usage for the write. By changing white-space rule to pre-line, it's possible to write documents and render linebreaks as they appear on the editor. It's also good to keep in mind that it's not supported on all devices so your mileage may vary on how useful it actually is.

Last but not the least, a-elements! Without making a deep dive into its soul, "a" is there simply to provide you a way to link to other sites. Internal or external. Not only are they clickable, it is possible to shorten the displayed link to whatever you wish. A great way to hide long ugly URLs without relying on yet another third party service for link shortening.

JavaScript (JS) on the other hand is a completely different beast. You want to display text? No need for it. You want to manipulate data in real time, display complex graphics and provide dynamic content? Go ahead, but don't forget to read on serverside rendering and figuring out if that fits your needs! For the sake of simplicity, we are going to drop JS out of the picture completely.

## Drawbacks
- Website might render or not due to not actually being proper HTML (no html element) beyond having .html extension
- Poor search engine discoverability (hard to test, but very likely due to lack of metadata and broken HTML)
- Not accessible for impaired people (sorry!) 

## Workflow
To render proper HTML without actually writing it, one can find static-site-generators (SSGs) quite useful. While great for managing complex structures, they really seem to fall short on delivering and deployment. You need a build step, which is most likely very prone to breaking if things are not configured with utmost care and precision. When this step fails, you are left with nothing to show. My solution is to just write basic text files by following the tips as described so far directly on GitHub. It's not only easy, but also possible to use on web browsers without any special tooling.
