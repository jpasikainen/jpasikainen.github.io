## Q&A
Q: Where on the web did I arrive this time?
A: Well, this is my website and I post things here.

Q: What's the point of this site?
A: I link this site from my resume (CV) so I can include additional documents and text that otherwise do not fit in. I also want to have a simple sharable space to write on. Instead of relying on npm packages and complicated build processes, I want to try out something manageable. Less time spent on maintanance is more time for creating the actual content. Which is not AI generated by the way.

Q: Are you trying to follow HTML semantics?
A: No, it's too cumbersome. To see for yourself, check the source code or inspect on the browser directly. Renders anyway.
